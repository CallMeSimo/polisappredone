Redo of my first react (team) project, polis app!

I was not satisfied with how I performed on that project so I challanged myself to make it again but better, this includes:
  - Efficient code
  - Less API calls
  - MUCH better understanding of functionalities (useStates, useEffects, ReactDom...)

<h1> What is this?</h1>
<p>This app can search the name of Swedish cities and recall crimes that has occured there with a props including:</p>

  - Title
  - Date
  - Summary
  - Link to police report
  
<p>The scope of this project is to inform and update the people on the types of crimes that are regularly happening around them, not everyone knows what has occuring in their city and this is a fast way of searching and informing oneself. </p>


<h2>Future plans:</h2>
<p>I am trying to make the best version of the police App with better functionality and more. This project will not be my main focus but more of a side / hobby prject, meaning some features will be slow. Things to make in the future are:</p>

  - The last one had a category system(which I made) that could show you the selected one, make that but prettier and better.
  - Turn into a mobile App
  - Notification system
  - Priority based on distance
